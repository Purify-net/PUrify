    <description>The Uri classes in .NET prior to 4.5 and Mono scrub through your Uris and modify them in order to prevent vulnerabilities, for example escaped slashes are unescaped. This scrubbing however prevents Uris that are inline with RFC 3986. Beyond that it prevents using .NET's HTTP clients (HttpClient and WebClient) to talk to APIs that require accessing resources using escaped slashes unless you are using .NET 4.5. PUrify will ensure that the Uri remains untouched. How does it do that? Well it hacks into the Uri internals and ensures that the original Uri is preserved.</description>
